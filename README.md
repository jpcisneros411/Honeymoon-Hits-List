  ## Description 

  The Honeymoon Hits List application allows a user an alternative to the traditional online registry that you would make at a big box store. The idea is that if a couple doesn't just want the traditional new blender for their wedding they can go online and list what they are interested in actually getting for their pre- post- and during wedding plans. What's a dream wedding without a Honeymoon Hit. This application utilizes an easy to maneuver front-end which is built up using Handlebars.js, HTML, CSS and a backend that utilizes Express.js and Sequlize. The application also boasts a MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure. The idea came from my own personal life as I am soon to be married and our family wanted to know where I registry was hosted. We didn't want to have a traditional registry because we had already been living with each other and could have all of things we could "need" so we wanted a way to get what we want with a little help from our friends and family.


  ## Installation 

  In order to install this application and run it as it is in its current state on Heroku: a user would first have to first clone this repo, customize it to their liking, create a Heroku account (Heroku is an application hosting service that is owned by the Salesforce Family of Companies), and push their changes to Heroku. Profit. 


  ## Usage 

  The application use is simple: A first time user will have to register there account and from there  they can make their first Honeymoon Hit item and how much they expect it to cost. They can then share the website with their friends or family and from their people can pay towards their dream that isn't a blender (but totally could be).
